# Katas-and-challenges
Space to keep track of katas and challenges (mainly from hackerrank and codewars)

### Language and setup
* Python 3.9.1
* Pytest
* Pipenv
* VS Code

### Goal
Like many newbie coders, I recently started solving the challenges from hackerrank and codewars. I was suggested to upload these to a repo as it would be a good way to showcase these excercises to potential employers.  
I thought it was indeed a good idea. So I created this repo where I could not only take on the challenges but also use it as an additional space to implement the **best practices** we were taught during our bootcamp, particularly:  
* TDD
* Pair programmning for most of the challenges
* git change tracking  
  
Any suggestion aiming at improving such best practices are welcome!
