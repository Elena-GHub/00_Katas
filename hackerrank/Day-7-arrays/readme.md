### Day 7 - Arrays  
  
**note**: as of Day 5, bear in mind the adjustments noted in the comments because we worked on these exercises with TDD and applying as much as possible SOLID principles.  
Therefore for a mere submission of the code to hackerrank, those adjustments are required. Such adjustments usually consists of:
- removing all "self" references as the code for hackerrank does not involve creating a class.
- quite often swapping a `return whatever` for a `print(whatever)`
- sometimes commenting or uncommenting some lines
